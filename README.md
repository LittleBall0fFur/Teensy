The code for my self made controller. This controller was made with a game called the guardian.
Both the game and the controller were made by me.

The desing of the controller was a wizards staff. De controller has a large ball on top of the controller which the player uses to move around in the game. Also the controller contains two buttons for attacking and opening the in-game menu.
